# The first guardrail for AI-written Java

**open-java-format** is a deterministic formatter for Java. There is one style and nothing to tune,
so every file comes out the same way, whether a person or a model wrote it.

## Why formatting comes first

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :lucide-equal:{ .lg .middle } __One style, nothing to tune__

    ---

    The output depends only on the input. There is no line-length setting, no indentation setting
    and no per-team dialect for an agent to get wrong. The IDE, the command line and CI all produce
    the same bytes.

-   :lucide-git-pull-request-arrow:{ .lg .middle } __Diffs a reviewer can read__

    ---

    Models write a lot of code quickly. When all of it is laid out the same way, a diff shows what
    changed in the logic, not how a particular model likes to wrap its lines.

-   :lucide-zap:{ .lg .middle } __Fast enough to run after every edit__

    ---

    The formatter ships as a native binary with no JVM to start, so it fits into an
    [agent hook](ai-agents.md), a pre-commit hook or a CI step. It also comes as a Gradle plugin
    and as plugins for IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse.

A formatter does not find bugs. It is the first check in the chain, ahead of the compiler, static
analysis, tests and review, and it is the cheapest one to automate.

## What the output looks like

Lines are up to 120 characters wide. A lambda stays on the line where it starts, and a long call
chain breaks into one call per line.

                                                                mapping.allVariants(

                                                            }));
                        });
    }
    ```

## Quick start

### In a Gradle build

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy title="build.gradle"
    plugins {
        id 'dev.openjavaformat.java-format' version '{{ ojf_version }}'
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
    plugins {
        id("dev.openjavaformat.java-format") version "{{ ojf_version }}"
    }
    ```

``` properties title="gradle.properties"
openjavaformat.native.formatter=true
```

The plugin adds the `formatDiff` task, which formats only the lines you changed in git, and it keeps
IntelliJ IDEA on the formatter version of the build. The property makes Gradle run the formatter as
a native binary on Linux and macOS. For Windows and for multi-project builds see
[Gradle plugin](get-started/gradle.md).

### On the command line

Every [release](https://github.com/openjavaformat/open-java-format/releases/latest) carries native
binaries for Linux, macOS and Windows, and a runnable jar for Java 21 or later.

``` sh title="Format files in place"
open-java-format --replace src/main/java/com/example/Hello.java
```

``` sh title="Fail when anything is not formatted"
open-java-format --dry-run --set-exit-if-changed $(git ls-files '*.java')
```

Downloads, checksums and every option are on the [Command line](get-started/command-line.md) page.

### In CI with GitHub Actions

``` yaml title=".github/workflows/format.yml"
- uses: actions/checkout@v7

- uses: openjavaformat/open-java-format-action@v2
  with:
    version: '{{ ojf_version }}'
```

The [action](https://github.com/openjavaformat/open-java-format-action) downloads the native binary
and fails the job when a changed file is not formatted. It needs no Java on the runner. The
[GitHub Action and pre-commit](get-started/github-actions.md) page has the full workflow and a git
hook that runs the same check.

## A drop-in for palantir-java-format

For the whole 2.x line the output is byte-for-byte the same as the palantir-java-format release
with the same version number, and the Java packages are unchanged. Migrating means changing the
coordinates and nothing else: [Migrate](migrate.md) lists every name that changes.
